        <h1>My name is Edgar</h1>
        <p>I am enjoying learning how to code and how to create things by just typing in commands. This semester has been kind of difficult but I continue to push through regardless of where I am in life because I hope to make it somewhere that I can give people the things that I hoped for which is most of all love. I am currently still a full time worker at an Amazon Warehouse i would like to advance on to something that helps a bit more. So far this has felt like learning how to play a video game and I really am enojying it.</p>
